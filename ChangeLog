- Fixed problem with plotting location-scale depth.

Changes in DepthProc 2.0.2

Bug fixes

- Buffer overflow in refRank c++ function.

Changes in DepthProc 2.0

Version 2.0 comes with a lot of breaking changes! There is high chance that old code will not work with the new version! However, if you just used the `depth` function or its different version like `depthTukey`, there shouldn't be any problems.

If you have any problem with migrating from version 1.0.7 to 2.0, please fill an issue on https://github.com/zzawadz/DepthProc/issues or send an e-mail to zygmunt@zstat.pl.

Breaking changes:
- `combineDepthCurves` replaced `%+%` operator (`%+%` is no longer available).
- New interface for plotting functions. Parameters for depth function are passed using `depth_params` argument, and parameters for drawing function using `graph_params`.
- New interface for `mWilcoxonTest` and `depthMedian` and `depthLocal`.

Introduced functional depth:
- Introduced new interface for functional depth with `fncDepth`
- `fncDepthMBD` - Modified Band Depth
- `fncDepthFM` - Frainman-Muniz depth for functional data
- `fncBoxPlot` - create functional boxplot based on depth function.

Bug fixes

- Calculate scale and asymmetry curve based on quantiles of depth rather than raw values.
- Add missing root in LPdepth.
